Medical School Notes - Medicina e Chirurgia @unibo :hospital: :memo: :mortar_board:  	ðŸ‘¨

This notes are a culmination of my medical school career. The notes are made while attending lectures, reading lectures material, books or lectures transcripts. They contains, as well, personal thoughts and elaborations, so do not expect them to be exact, reliable or in any way complete. These notes are ment for personal reference purposes only, to have a simple, searchable and quick knowledge base useful while practicing medicine. __You should not, in any way and under any circumstance, consider them as a solid or up to date base to make decision regarding your health or that of others__.

Please, if you note errors submit an issue, and I'll try to review it --you know, college is tough.
